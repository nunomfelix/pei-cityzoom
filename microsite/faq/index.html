                                        <p>Occupation: Aveiro’ Secretary for Environment
                                            </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Filipe is a respected mechanical engineer known for his work in making wind turbines more efficient. 
                                            Also for this reason the mayor of Aveiro invited him to be his secretary for environment and he did not refuse. 
                                            Living in a smart city as Aveiro he thought he would have an easier control over the city current ambiental status and traffic. 
                                            To his disappointment he had a lot of data coming from many sensors around the city, but he could only visualize it in a rudimentar and inefficient way. 
                                            He could not visualize the environmental data with ease and the traffic data were only tables that offer little to no help. 
                                            If he wanted to find irregularities he would have to search all sensors one by one and identify if there was an irregularity and in which sensor. 
                                            Besides being tedious, all this task would be very much time consuming, time he needed for various other things. 
                                            Because of this need of time he tried to find a system that could help him firstly visualize the data he got from the sensors and secondly to help him find irregularities within the city environment or traffic.

                                            Joana is a 23 year old student of environmental engineering whose masters thesis is about the impact of green areas in the city environment and how it affects the well being of the citizens. 
                                            She always liked city green areas since her childhood because these were the places where she saw a little bit of nature in her city. 
                                            This was the reason why she chose this theme for her masters thesis. 
                                            She finds it extremely difficult to collect, modulate and analyze all environmental data about the city while also collecting data from the city inhabitants. 
                                            This difficulty arises mainly because when she wants to analyze the behaviour of the citizens she needs someone to collect the environmental data in parallel and needs also to modulate all of it while still needing to analyze it so the tests made can be more accurate. 
                                            To simplify this task she would need a system that could give the environmental data about the city in a fast and accurate way and compare the results of any given moment with another in a visible and meaningful way other than just plain tables with data. 
                                            For her, this system would give her access to the data that she preciously needs without effort and would allow her to gather the citizens data in a more efficient way and speed up the analyzing process.

                                            Ricardo is a 21 year old computer science student and is currently working with IoT systems. 
                                            He’s not one of the best of his class because he’s what we can call a ‘slacker’, he likes to enjoy life besides just studying. 
                                            He’s also not the worst because he enjoys practicing his skill with projects outside his course. 
                                            Besides all of this he’s also a fan of the environment and thinks that we should all contribute for a sustainable future in order to enjoy life more. 
                                            In one of his ideas for projects he thought that he could do something to help in the environmental aspect of his city. 
                                            He thought of a system that could display all the environmental data and that he or any other person could provide such data in a simple and mannered way. 
                                            In order to do this the only thing he knows from classes are hard to learn and not scalable technologies, so he goes on looking for a system that is both simple and in which he can provide his own data.

                                            At sunday mornings, Ricardo likes to take his dog to the park. There he likes to jog a bit and then come home to take a nice warm bath. When he woke up and opened up his window he felt an enormous heat wave coming inside his bedroom and thought that today might be too hot in the park for him to run or for his dog to accompany him. In order to avoid having to drive nearly 20 minutes from the suburbs to the park he goes to his phone and checks the city park status in the CityZoom App. After finding that the park where he usually goes he checks the temperature in the temperature heatmap and finds out that it is actually much warmer than his own suburb and decides he’ll be spending the day there taking some sun baths.

                                            Ricardo finally found out about the CityZoom system and immediately downloaded the CityZoom App. When he found out that with CityZoom App he could get credentials to publish the data coming from his sensors at home directly into the CityZoom service he was amazed. Now he just has to find which type of sensor he can put (temperature, IR radiation, UV radiation, visible radiation, etc) on the system and send a request to the CityZoom main server, has exemplified in the app. With this app he finally grasped a little bit of how the environment was evolving at his home even when he was far away.
                                        </p>
                                    </div>
                                </div>
                                <div class=item>
                                    <div class=item-link><a data-toggle=collapse data-parent=#accordions2 href=#accordion27>Scenario #7: Mobile sensors</a></div>

                                            Filipe has reached a conclusion: all the data coming from the sensors is great and helps a lot, but some areas usually have their sensors broken. In order to do this he asks to install mobile sensors in the trash cars and taxis of the city. With this he’ll get data from every place that the vehicles pass. With the application being run on generic requests and not specific interfaces for just a few sensors, Filipe can buy many sensors at a small price and the installation costs will also be low. With this, Filipe will get an even smarter city at a smaller cost, making his image as Aveiro’s Secretary for the Environment become even greater.
